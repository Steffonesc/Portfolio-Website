                  <h3>1. Ideate</h3>
                  <h3> Competitive Analysis</h3>
                  <p>
                    How will I get the information for the app?
                    To gather all the information for the app I decided to do a competitive analysis
                    and user interviews to help me figure out what I like about the other apps and what would be useful for users.

                    Competitive Analysis

                    To get a better understanding of the competitors that are similar to my app I did
                    a competitive analysis to compare the strengths and weaknesses from each of those apps.
                    It gave me the opportunity to see what I liked from the other apps and possibly get
                    inspiration from it. I analyzed two apps and created a SWOT profile for both of them.
                    I really had a tougher time finding apps like GoHelp. The only apps that I really found
                    were either international apps or some that were not very good. On a good note there were
                    some really good things I did take away from these two apps. Some of the things were how
                    easy the usability was on both apps, the features got main to the point, and also helped
                    me add things to my app that these didn't have.

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                      After doing the competitive analysis I decided what audience
                      I want to target and what problem I wanna solve for my users.

                    <h3>User Research</h3>
                    <p>
                      During the user research phase I interviewed three potential users.
                       All of different age, background, and occupations. I analyzed of their
                        behaviors & attitudes, needs & goals, and frustrations. After I
                         interviewed the participants I created an affinity map. I found
                         a total of three clusters that gives me insight of Filters & Organization,
                         Credibility of Experts, and Feelings about Education & Experience.
                          This user research helped me learn what users wanted in my app and
                          what would really be useful in the GoHelp app.

                      <p>
                      Based on the information I gathered from the user interviews
                       I created two user personas. Liora represents my younger audience
                       who is currently in school. Barbara represents the old audience
                        who is currently has a job. Both of these user personas were
                        important to the design process a good amount of the design
                        decisions were based on these personas.

                          <h3> User Journey Maps</h3>
                          <p>
                          After making the user personas I created user journey maps.
                          I built these maps to gain a better understanding of my personas.
                          It helped me visualize the process of how the user will accomplish
                           the objectives. This helped me get ideas early on how I
                            should make the app.

                        <p>
                          After the User Journey Maps I laid out the three objectives.
                          My three objectives is to book a call with a Expert,
                          message an Expert, and submit a review for an expert.
                           Later on in the design process I redid my book a call
                            user flow. This really helped on how the flow of the
                            app was going to be.

                       <p>
                         After doing the user flows and having the three tasks
                         laid out I created wireframes I designed my first
                         low-fidelity wireframe on paper. The first low-fidelity
                         was not as good but it still showed how I want my app's
                         layout to be. Once I was done with the low-fidelity I
                         started to do mid-fidelity on Axure. Before user testing
                          I started to do my high-fidelity wireframes and making
                          the prototype interactive. At the point I was done with
                           the high-fidelity my UX was fine but my UI design could
                           have been better. Below are the main pages from low fidelity
                            to high fidelity.

                      the users were having a tough time finding the review section.
                       It was a little confusing to find where to review the past
                       experts since it was in a section called actions. So what
                       I did was take away the whole actions section and replaced
                       it with a review section.

                        not a big usability problem the only issue was that some
                        of the users wanted the messaging icon slightly bigger.

                 software for me. It took me a while to learn but I ended up
                 learning it. I went through a lot of trials and errors even
                 having to redo my app design again. After a lot of trials and
                  errors I finished my final design.<a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/9BifZabdKRNcU8bmqQsma4/GoHelp-Finished-Product?node-id=5091%3A15&scaling=min-zoom">Click here for the Interactive prototype</a>.
